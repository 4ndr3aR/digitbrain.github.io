# DIGITbrain Project Documentation

## Digital Twins for Manufacturing SMEs

Compared to the digital twin concept, which is already increasingly used by
manufacturing companies today, the DIGITbrain concept will go one step further
by developing the 'Digital Product Brain' which will store data throughout the
entire life cycle of a production line or a machine.

By collecting all this data, it will be possible to customise and set-up machines
/ production assets for very specific manufacturing tasks whenever needed. This will
enable a new manufacturing model, called Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS), which will
allow for on-demand production of much more specialised products, even in smaller
quantities and still in an economically profitable way.

## About this documentation

The primary aim of this documentation is to serve as a point of reference for
providers and consumers of the different assets in DIGITbrain. These include
**Microservices**, **Algorithms**, **Model** and **Data**, as well as
**MA Pairs** and **DMA Tuples**.

The various metadata fields presented across this site are all automatically
updated based on the main DIGITbrain Metadata Specification stored under the
[DIGITbrain GitHub](https://github.com/DIGITbrain/digitbrain.github.io). They
are up-to-date with the very latest development version. For the latest stable
version, check the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DIGITbrain/digitbrain.github.io/releases)
page. Both versions are available as *.xlsx* Excel files, and can be used by
experiment partners who need to provide metadata values describing their applications.

Please navigate the site using the available navigation bars. Metadata information
is available in both a table and list views. The Asset Overview pages may contain
extra helpful information for getting started.

**If you experience any issues using this site, or have any comments, please let us know by creating an [issue on Github](https://github.com/DIGITbrain/digitbrain.github.io/issues/new).**
