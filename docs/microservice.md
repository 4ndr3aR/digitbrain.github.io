# Microservices in DIGITbrain

## Introduction

Microservices are the smallest building-block in DIGITbrain.
They are containerised applications that provide some required functionality.
Microservices can be composed together to create an Algorithm, which uses
the functionality of potentially multiple Microservices to realise some goal.
