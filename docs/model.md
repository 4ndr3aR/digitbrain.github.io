# Models in DIGITbrain

## Introduction

A model in DIGITbrain is an asset that contains the knowledge related to a specific industrial product instance (i.e., a concrete manufacturing machine or production line), which can hence describe and forecast the behavior of such an instance when specific operating conditions are given (n.b., the process of forecasting a systemâ€™s behavior according to specific operating conditions is also known as model evaluation).

## Pre-requisites

Models must be accessible from Algorithms for evaluation, thus they must be located in the specific DIGITbrain Model repository.

## Metadata describing Models

For a closer look at this metadata, use the following resources:

- [Attribute Listing](attributes/model.md) for an itemised listing of fields
- [Metadata Table](tables/model.md) for a table-formatted overview
